# Analytical-Algorithm-for-Arrow-Direction-Recognition
An analytical algorithm for arrow direction searching (angle) in polar coordinate system

## Introduction
Nowadays, Autonomous vehicles have become a important topic in either industry or our society, and a reliable navigation system is always required for the automobiles. There are a lot of things that need to happen to make a working navigation system, but one of them is that there needs to be an algorithm that can read road signs.

Figure 1. Example of the signs

Each sign is associated with one direction in polar coordinate system, and our navigation system should be able to convert these signs to the direction the arrows have pointed to. An algorithm that based on 'Moment of Inertia' is designed to achieve this.
